<h2>
Another Chrome tabs recording extension..
</h2>
A more reliable Chrome extension to find my opened tabs. Unlike Chrome's restoring last opened tabs may not working properly when it crashes, TabsWQ can keep 24 snapshots of your tabs in the last 24 hours.

"wq" is short for ":wq", a VIM's command, which is to save and quit the vi/vim editor with saving the changes you've made.
